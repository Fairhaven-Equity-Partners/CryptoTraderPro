# Current Working Version Backup - Save Point

**Date:** June 06, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… App running successfully with positioned components  
**Components:** Enhanced Technical Analysis and Compact Performance Dashboard positioned correctly

## Current State
- Fixed JSX syntax errors that were causing app crashes

- Compact Performance Dashboard positioned after technical analysis  
- Both components appear above heatmap section as requested
- App successfully loading and displaying all components

## Key Files Working:
- `client/src/pages/Analysis.tsx` - Main layout with proper component positioning
- `client/src/components/EnhancedTechnicalAnalysis.tsx` - Compact technical indicators
- `client/src/components/CompactPerformanceDashboard.tsx` - Performance metrics display
- `client/src/components/AdvancedSignalDashboard.tsx` - Market analysis section

## Current Layout Flow:
1. Status Bar
2. Header with asset selection
3. Price Overview
4. Advanced Signal Dashboard (Market Analysis)
5. Enhanced Technical Analysis (NEW - positioned correctly)
6. Compact Performance Dashboard (NEW - positioned correctly)  
7. Signal Heatmap (collapsible)

## Issues to Address:
- Font styling consistency needs improvement
- Potential code redundancy requires review
- Component consolidation opportunities

This is a stable rollback point before making styling and consolidation changes.
