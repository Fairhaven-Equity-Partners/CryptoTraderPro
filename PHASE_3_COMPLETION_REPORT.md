## Technical Implementation Details

### Prediction Record Structure
```typescript
interface PredictionRecord {
  id: string;
  symbol: string;
  timeframe: string;
  direction: 'LONG' | 'SHORT';
  entryPrice: number;
  entryTime: number;
  predictedExitPrice: number;
  stopLoss: number;
  takeProfit: number;
  confidence: number;
  indicators: any;
  
  // Outcome tracking
  actualExitPrice?: number;
  actualExitTime?: number;
  exitReason?: 'TAKE_PROFIT' | 'STOP_LOSS' | 'TIMEOUT' | 'MANUAL';
  profitLoss?: number;
  profitLossPercent?: number;
  isCorrect?: boolean;
  
  // Performance metrics
  accuracyScore?: number;
  timingAccuracy?: number;
  priceAccuracy?: number;
  
  status: 'ACTIVE' | 'COMPLETED' | 'EXPIRED';
}
```

### Performance Calculation Algorithm
```typescript
// Comprehensive accuracy scoring
const directionAccuracy = prediction.isCorrect ? 100 : 0;
const priceAccuracy = this.calculatePriceAccuracy(predictedExitPrice, actualExitPrice, entryPrice);
const timingAccuracy = this.calculateTimingAccuracy(prediction);

prediction.accuracyScore = (directionAccuracy * 0.5) + (priceAccuracy * 0.3) + (timingAccuracy * 0.2);
```

### Enhanced Confidence Calculation
```typescript
// Reliability-based confidence enhancement
const reliabilityMultiplier = this.calculateIndicatorReliability(indicators);
const learningMultiplier = this.getLearningMultiplier(symbol, timeframe, indicators);
const enhancedConfidence = baseConfidence * reliabilityMultiplier * learningMultiplier;
```

### Learning Data Processing
```typescript
// Pattern recognition and learning
const similarScenarios = data.filter(record => {
  return this.areIndicatorsSimilar(record.indicators, indicators);
});

const avgAccuracy = similarScenarios.reduce((sum, scenario) => {
  return sum + (scenario.outcome.accuracyScore || 0);
}, 0) / similarScenarios.length;
```
