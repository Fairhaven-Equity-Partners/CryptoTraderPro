const volatilityFactor = Math.min(1, volatility / 10);
const dynamicWeights = {
  rsi: 0.25 * (1 - volatilityFactor * 0.3),
  macd: 0.20 * (1 + volatilityFactor * 0.2),
  bollinger: 0.15 * (1 + volatilityFactor * 0.3),
  atr: 0.15 * (1 + volatilityFactor * 0.5),
  stochastic: 0.25 * (1 - volatilityFactor * 0.2)
};

// Multi-timeframe confluence scoring
const timeframeWeight = timeframeWeights[tf] || 0.3;
const timeframeAdjustedConfidence = confidence * (0.7 + timeframeWeight * 0.3);
